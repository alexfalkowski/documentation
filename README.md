Documentation
=============

This repository contains work that I like to document. Below is a description of the folders that you might find.

blog
----

This folder contains documents that I create to be part of my blog. I like to use [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) as it is portable and I don't have to pay for it.

The blog is located at [blogger](http://alexfalkowski.blogspot.com.au/)
 
resume
------

Contains current copies of my resume. This is reflected in my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=195604048) account.
